My name is Shang Zhou, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). My research is centered on enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on their evaluation, efficiency, and controllability.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep background in competitive programming. I am an **ICPC World Finalist** (22nd Place, 2023) and a **Codeforces International Grandmaster**. This experience provides me with a unique perspective on algorithmic problem-solving and informs my work on pushing the boundaries of AI in complex reasoning tasks.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about building more capable and reliable AI systems. My primary interests include:

* **LLM Evaluation and Benchmarking:** Developing robust frameworks to accurately assess the capabilities and limitations of LLMs on complex tasks, such as competitive programming and advanced reasoning.
* **Efficient LLM Inference:** Designing novel algorithms and strategies to reduce the computational cost of LLM inference while maintaining or even improving accuracy.
* **Controllable Text Generation:** Creating methods to precisely and smoothly control the attributes (e.g., style, formality, sentiment) of generated text.
* **AI for Complex Problem Solving:** Exploring the intersection of AI and competitive programming to enhance the reasoning and observational skills of intelligent agents.

## News
* **June 2025:** Our work on *LiveCodeBench Pro* was featured in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/24/1119187/fix-ai-evaluation-crisis/).
* **May 2025:** Our paper, "Scaling LLM Inference with Optimized Sample Compute Allocation," was accepted to **NAACL 2025**.
* **July 2024:** Honored to serve as the President & ICPC Team Coach for the [UCSD Competitive Programming Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ucsd.icpc/).
* **April 2024:** Our team won the **Champion** title in the ICPC NSA Challenge.

## Seeking Collaboration

I am actively seeking motivated and passionate students (undergraduate or master's) to collaborate on research projects. If you are excited about AI and eager to publish at top-tier conferences, I would love to hear from you.

**How to Reach Out:**
Please send me an email at **shz060@ucsd.edu** with the subject line `[Collaboration Interest]`.

**Please include in your email:**
* Your CV (optional but recommended).
* A brief description of your research interests or specific problems you find exciting.
* A summary of your programming skills and any relevant project experience.

**What I Offer:**
* Guidance on cutting-edge research ideas.
* Mentorship in code implementation and experimental design.
* Access to necessary computational resources (compute power).
* Dedicated support throughout the paper writing and publication process.

Our goal is to produce high-impact work for publication at premier venues like **NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP**. I am committed to helping my collaborators achieve their academic and professional goals, including securing first-author publications for Ph.D. applications or gaining invaluable research experience.
