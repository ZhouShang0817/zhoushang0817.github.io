excerpt: 'We developed a novel evaluation framework to assess the fine-grained control of attributes in text generated by LLMs. Using GPT-4 as a judge and an Elo rating system, our work quantifies control calibration and consistency across five attributes for various prompting and representation editing (RepE) methods.'

Current methods for controlling LLM text generation often lack fine-grained precision. We introduce a robust framework to evaluate how "smoothly" models can control attribute intensity (e.g., varying the level of positivity in a sentence). Our findings provide a clearer understanding of the capabilities and limitations of existing control techniques.
